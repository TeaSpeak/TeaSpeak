# Official TeaSpeak Issue Tracker

Welcome here! This repository is created with two reasons:
1. People can bring their own ideas and follow their implementation
2. People can see TeaSpeak progress and avoid creating repetitive issues all the time.


To **report an issue**, then find and push the **New Issue** button, fill all the fields you see in a template, and then click the **Submit new issue** button.


You can also ask questions here, if you have any.
