Usage: serverlist [-uid] [-short] [-all] [-onlyoffline]

Permissions:
  b_serverinstance_virtualserver_list

Description:
  Displays a list of virtual servers including their ID, status, number of
  clients online, etc. If you're using the -all option, the server will list
  all virtual servers stored in the database. This can be useful when multiple
  server instances with different machine IDs are using the same database. The
  machine ID is used to identify the server instance a virtual server is
  associated with.
  The status of a virtual server can be either online, offline, booting up,
  shutting down or virtual online. While most of them are self-explanatory,
  virtual online is a bit more complicated.
  Whenever you select a virtual server which is currently stopped with the
  -virtual parameter, it will be started in virtual mode which means you are
  able to change its configuration, create channels or change permissions, but
  no regular TeamSpeak 3 Client can connect. As soon as the last ServerQuery
  client deselects the virtual server, its status will be changed back to
  offline.

Example:
  serverlist
  virtualserver_id=1 virtualserver_port=9987 virtualserver_status=online virtualserver_clientsonline=6 ...
  error id=0 msg=ok
