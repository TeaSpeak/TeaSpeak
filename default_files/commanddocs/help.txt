TeaSpeak Server command overview

ServerQuery is a command-line interface built into the TeaSpeak server which
allows powerful scripting and automation tools to be built based on the exact
same instruction set and functionality provided by the TeaSpeak Web-Client. For
example, you can use scripts to automate the management of virtual servers or
nightly backups. In short, you can perform operations more efficiently by using
ServerQuery scripts than you can by using a user interface. Most file are created
and copied from the TeamSpeak 3 server query documentation directory.
