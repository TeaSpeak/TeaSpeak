Description:
  Initializes a file transfer download. clientftfid is an arbitrary ID to
  identify the file transfer on client-side. On success, the server generates a
  new ftkey which is required to start downloading the file through TeamSpeak
  3's file transfer interface. Since version 3.0.13 there is an optional proto
  parameter. The client can request a protocol version with it. Currently only
  0 and 1 are supported which only differ in the way they handle some timings.
  The server will reply which protocol version it will support. The server will
  reply with an ip parameter if it determines the filetransfer subsystem is not
  reachable by the ip that is currently being used for the query connection.

Example:
  ftinitdownload clientftfid=1 name=\/image.iso cid=5 cpw= seekpos=0
  clientftfid=1 serverftfid=7 ftkey=NrOga\/4d2GpYC5oKgxuclTO37X83ca\/1 port=30033 size=673460224 proto=0
  error id=0 msg=ok
