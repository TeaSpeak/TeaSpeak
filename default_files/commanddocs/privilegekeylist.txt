Usage: privilegekeylist

Permissions:
  b_virtualserver_token_list

Description:
  Displays a list of privilege keys available including their type and group
  IDs. Tokens can be used to gain access to specified server or channel groups.
  A privilege key is similar to a client with administrator privileges that
  adds you to a certain permission group, but without the necessity of a such a
  client with administrator privileges to actually exist. It is a long (random
  looking) string that can be used as a ticket into a specific server group.

Example:
  privilegekeylist
  token=88CVUg\/zkujt+y+WfHdko79UcM4R6uyCL6nEfy3B token_type=0 token_id1=9 token_id2=0 ...
  error id=0 msg=ok
